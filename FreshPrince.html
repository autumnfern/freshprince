     <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>I discovered coding purely by accident. I started working for a dot com in 1998 - just as the internet was emerging from it's infancy. I worked for RealEstate.com. We started as a B2C web site, then suddenly we changed to a B2B web site. In all honesty, it was a web site ahead of it's time. Already we were building apps to run templated web sites for realtors, title agents and house inspectors. </p>
     <p>
   While the services were well received - people were not ready to sign up. So our bubble burst and with it, the company. From there, I went on to work for a title agent who loved that I had background in real estate! I stayed with that company for about ten years then decided I was ready to try contracting. I have have been working for myself for about 6 years now and have never regretted one minute of it. </p></section>

     <h2>Where am I (from)?</h2>
     <p>Originally, I am from coastal North Carolina. I grew up avoiding tourists and thinking the beach was the best place to be in the winter. Growing up in a small town, I couldn't wait to move to the big city. Any big city would work. First I moved to Raleigh, NC</span>, followed by Atlanta, GA and now I live in Washington, DC. </p></section>
   
  
  <section class="questions-section"><h2>More About Me</h2>
  <h3>What are my favorite hobbies?</h3>
   <p>Hobbies are great, aren't they? A way to broaden your horizons, meet new people and explore new places.</p>
<p>I love to travel - I will pretty much go anywhere. Anytime. I love traveling with my kids since they experience places differently than I do. They always add a great perspective while traveling either through their many questions or though their gastronomic experiences. </p>
 
<p>I love to cook. While visiting Portland a few years ago, my husband and I went to a "Mac &amp; Cheese" cook-off. We met some great new people and as Southerns, we loved eating Mac &amp; Cheese with a west coast flair. So we brought the contest idea home with us and had our own Mac &amp; Cheese cook-off as well as a &quot;French Food&quot; cook-off. We keep the rules simple, make sure everyone gets a vote, and always provide prizes for the winners. Needless to say the contest is always fun and we usually start picking the new theme by the end of the evening. This year we had a  lot of votes for a &quot;Spam Off&quot;. The judges are still out on this one.</p>

<p>Finally, I love running - for me there is no better way to clear my head then to be outside, either on the pavement or on the trails, running along, peacefully.</p>
   
 <h3>What's my dream job?</h3><p>My dream job allows me to work remotely, on a part-time basis. I love having the flexibility of being at home and making my own schedule. This flexibility allows me to go running (see above) cook (see above) or spend time with my kids. I have enjoyed contracting with different companies because it allows me to work with lots of different personalities, skill sets and challenges.  I suppose to make it more dreamy, my house could be in an exotic location that allowed me to easily travel to lots of new places.</p>

<h3>What music have I been listening to lately?</h3>
   <p>Music is one of those things that I was so passionate about when I was younger. But as I have gotten older (and busier), I find myself gravitating to the artists I have been listening to forever. However with the introduction of Pandora and Spotify, I have been able to find a few new bands and artists that would have stayed underground before these new technologies. Some new bands I have discovered over the last few years are <a href="http://www.drdogmusic.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Dog</a>, <a href="http://tune-yards.com/" target="_blank">the Tune Yards</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moldy_Peaches" target="_blank">the Moldy Peaches</a>, <a href="http://www.reginaspektor.com/" target="_blank">Regina Specktor</a> and a few others. </p>
